                    <li>
                      <strong>4.16.1. </strong> Services: A retainer project is
                      a particular type of Project where HepDex undertakes to
                      deliver services to the Client on an ongoing basis for a
                      monthly pre-determined price. The services will be
                      executed by an Expert engaged by HepDex directly to the
                      Client. The services can be in the form of either a number
                      of monthly hours or a predetermined work, which is to be
                      specified in the SoW. A retainer project as well as the
                      SoW are subject to the Terms and Conditions and other
                      written policies and procedures posted on the HepDex
                      Platform subject to the adjustments set out in this Clause
                      4.16.

                    <li>
                      <strong>4.16.2. </strong> Billing period and payment: A
                      retainer project is paid on a monthly basis. One retainer
                      period corresponds to the duration of one month. A
                      retainer project can start on any day of the month. The
                      Client is to pay the monthly amount at the beginning of
                      each retainer period. The Client will be automatically
                      billed for each retainer period at the same day each
                      subsequent month until the SoW is terminated. At the end
                      of a retainer period, the Client’s payment will be
                      considered non-refundable and any unused hours will not be
                      carried over from one retainer period to the following.

                      <strong>4.16.3. </strong> Additional work: Any work that
                      is deemed outside of the scope of the retainer project, as
                      set out in the SoW, must be agreed upon in a separate SoW.

                    <li>
                      <strong>4.16.4. </strong> Client responsibilities: The
                      Client understands that the Expert is not an employee of
                      the Client and that the retainer project is a
                      collaborative, professional relationship of equals where
                      mutual professional respect, courtesy, and consideration
                      are expected. The Client understands that the Expert
                      requires fair, realistic notice in order to attend to
                      requests.

                      <strong>4.16.5. </strong> Term and termination of a
                      retainer project: The term of a retainer project commences
                      on the date of acceptance of the SoW and continues in
                      effect until terminated. Both the Client and the Expert
                      may terminate the SoW at any time, with or without cause,
                      effective immediately upon written notice to the other
                      party. Unless otherwise agreed in the SoW, (i) the Expert
                      must continue to perform the Services for the remainder of
                      the retainer period during which the SoW is terminated,
                      unless otherwise requested by the Client, and (ii) the
                      Client will not be entitled to recover any payments made
                      related to the retainer period during which the SoW is
                      terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, the Client will
                      not be charged for the retainer period that follows the
                      retainer period during which the SoW was terminated.
